# FakeOllyDbg

Fake [ollydbg.exe](ollydbg.exe?raw=true) just creates a hidden window of a class name "OllyDbg" and a title "OllyDbg".
Some malwares adapt anti-debugging techniques, which are to find debuggers in the system and, if found, stop malicious activities.
So, running this fake ollydbg.exe may protect your system from malwares.

Note that some nonmalicious games and proprietary softwares also detect debuggers.
